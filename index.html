            <article>
                <p>What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? 
                    Dev Dish was founded by two passionate developers who turned their 
                    love for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding 
                    by day and cooking by night, they decided to merge their two passions 
                    and create something extraordinary.
                </p>
                <p>Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, offering a menu
                     full of creative, tech-inspired dishes. Whether you're a tech enthusiast 
                     or a food lover, our offerings are designed to satisfy both your appetite 
                     and your curiosity.
                </p>
                <p>Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends who met at a hackathon 
                    and discovered a shared love for innovative cuisine. With a background in 
                    software development and a knack for culinary creativity, they embarked on
                     a journey to deliver delicious, tech-themed dishes to the community.
